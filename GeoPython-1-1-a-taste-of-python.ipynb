This particular notebook is designed to introduce you to a few of the basic concepts of programming in Python. The contents of this document are divided into cells, which can contain Markdown-formatted text, Python code, or raw text. You can execute a snippet of code in a cell by pressing **Shift-Enter**. Try this out with the examples below.\n\n### Getting started\n\nPresumably if you have made it this far, you have already opened this Jupyter Notebook using Binder, the CSC notebooks server, or on your own computer. If not, you can launch [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) by clicking on either of the launch buttons at the top of this document or by typing the following in a terminal window.\n\n```bash\n$ jupyter lab\n```\n\nThis should open a new Jupyter Lab session from which you can open this document by navigating its location in the **Files** tab and double clicking on it.

For example, ``sin()`` is a function that is part of the ``math`` module, and used by typing ``math.sin()`` with some number between the parentheses.\n\n3. Within a given Jupyter Notebook the variables you define earlier in the notebook will be available for use in the cells that follow as long as you have already executed the cells.\n\n4.
